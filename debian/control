Description: Atlassian Confluence
 Confluence Server is where you create, organise and discuss work with
 your team. Capture the knowledge that's too often lost in email inboxes
 and shared network drives in Confluence - where it's easy to find, use,
 and update. Give every team, project, or department its own space to
 create the things they need, whether it's meeting notes, product
 requirements, file lists, or project plans, you can get more done in
 Confluence.
